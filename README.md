   Some of my belongings are in a storage facility. That does not deminish the value of the items, there is just not enough space in the home(computer) to store everything I have. So at the storage facility my 
   belongings are protected by a pad lock on a door which is enclosed in a gate with a pin code security system, and also patroled by a secuirty guard. At home (computer) my belongings are protected by a security 
   system (firewall) and a deadbolt lock on the doors along with a kick door stop (Windows Defender Security Center). But if all that fails I have protection afforded to me by the second ammendment of the United 
   States Constitution (I know i compared the home security system the firewall, but this is the real firewall).
